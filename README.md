# MP3_TAG_READER
The MP3 Tag Reader is a small command-line program written in C.
It reads the hidden information (tags) inside an MP3 file.

It shows details like song name, artist, album, year, and genre.
The program works by reading the MP3 file directly, without using any libraries.

This project helps you learn file handling, binary data reading, and structures in C.
It is simple, fast, and works on Windows and Linux systems.
